When writing TypeScript code, we often encounter situations where object properties need to be added based on a certain condition. In this article, I'll show two approaches to achieve this â€” using a simple `if` statement and using the spread operator (`...`).

## Simple Approach with `if`

Let's assume we have an object that we are building based on various conditions. A classic way to add properties is to use an `if` statement.

```typescript
let user = {
  name: "Farid",
};

const isAdmin = true;

if (isAdmin) {
  user.role = "admin";
}

console.log(user); // { name: 'Farid', role: 'admin' }
```

In this example, if the `isAdmin` condition is true, we add the `role` property to the `user` object. This approach works, but it may become cumbersome when dealing with many objects and conditions.

## Using the Spread Operator (`...`)

The spread operator allows us to make the code more concise and expressive. In the following example, we use it for conditional property addition.

```typescript
const isAdmin = true;

const user = {
  name: "Farid",
  ...(isAdmin && { role: "admin" }),
};

console.log(user); // { name: 'Farid', role: 'admin' }
```

Here's what happens: if `isAdmin` is true, the expression `...(isAdmin && { role: "admin" })` returns the object `{ role: "admin" }`, which is then spread into the main `user` object. If `isAdmin` is false, the `&&` operator returns `false`, and nothing is added.

This method is not only more concise but also easier to read, especially when adding multiple properties based on different conditions.

## In Simple Words...

Both approaches have their advantages and can be used depending on the specific task. Using `if` may be more understandable for those who are just starting with TypeScript, but the spread operator makes the code more compact and readable.

Next time you need to add properties to an object, consider which of these methods will suit you better!
