## I'm Farid, a front-end developer coding away in beautiful Baku! ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¿

Welcome to my personal development blog/diary/notebook (call it what you like)! After countless browser tabs filled with Medium articles, Stack Overflow answers, and YouTube tutorials, I decided to create a central hub for my learnings and experiences.

Currently working at [R.I.S.K. Company](https://risk.az/products/panda), on a project focused on bringing aeronautical data to life on maps using powerful tools like OpenLayers and Cesium, I'll document my explorations, challenges, and triumphs as I navigate the world of geospatial visualization.

<!-- :::note[About my path in Angular] -->
> I'm diving into the exciting world of Angular Signals alongside Angular 17 and NgRX at work! Plus, I'm exploring the cutting-edge possibilities of a zoneless approach!

##### Expect to find a mix of:

- **Useful links and resources:** A curated collection of the most helpful articles, videos, and code snippets I come across.
- **Technical notes and insights:** Reflections on the intricacies of OpenLayers, Cesium, and other relevant technologies, including my experiences with Angular 17 and TypeScript.
- **Project updates and progress:** Sharing my journey as I build and refine the aeronautical data visualization project.
- **Musings on Angular and related libraries:** Occasional posts about my experiences with Angular 17, TypeScript, and other relevant libraries and tools in the Angular ecosystem.
- **Random ramblings:** Because sometimes, a developer's brain just needs to wander...

Thanks for joining me on this adventure! Let's take flight and explore the fascinating world of geospatial data visualization, Angular 17, and beyond.
